GUARDIAN IDEAL
Promotion Readiness Assessment most challenging aspects talent management identifying promoting best qualified individuals
Current performance best predictor future performance under similar conditions does predict adequately individual will perform with greater authority responsibility
Space Force will field construct that assesses promotion readiness using three indicators current performance situational judgment other behavioral components performance
approach that demands continual uninterrupted upward career trajectory will drive some vital talent service because perception that career opportunities permanently limited temporary circumstance
Additionally people sometimes need shift priorities based circumstances their lives that result shortterm leveling performance
Therefore extent permitted policy Space Force promotion process will only include rolling average recent performance information
This approach offers best potential limit bias maintain focus most relevant information
Limiting performance data timeframe further incentivizes Guardians take smart risks learn from mistakes because failures will follow them beyond rolling average window
This system better supports Guardians their personal professional lives well
While current performance necessary identify qualified promotion candidates does address sufficiently preparedness assume increased responsibilities
Situational judgment assessments superior tools this purpose
Unlike knowledgebased tests situational judgment assessments measure candidates ability address scenarios appropriate next grade
Using approved questions scoring rubric evaluators assess candidates exercise their judgment complex scenarios
final element construct builds safeguards against individuals demonstrate heightened propensity derailing behaviors traits that make them unsuited holding positions increased authority over others
Given relatively small size Space Force promoting individuals exhibiting these behaviors have significant longlasting negative consequences organization
Therefore necessary screen promotion candidates these behavioral components proven effective Armys Commander Assessment Program
Depending circumstances such screening could allow timely intervention enabling individual take affirmative steps toward resolving developing away from identified concerns
construct that includes current performance situational judgment other behavioral components affecting performance provides best insights into best qualified serve higher grade
While system involving human beings perfect this framework provides checks balances more points data better decisions
Centralized Concurrent Boards small size coupled with individualized approach talent management will allow consider whole person beyond record performance development assignment
